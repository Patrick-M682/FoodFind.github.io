During the class on networking, I learned the importance of a relevant LinkedIn profile to access the hidden job market. This includes creating a profile that gives employers important information about my skills, career goals, and past projects. I will also include a professional headshot picture. Once my LinkedIn profile is completed, I will stay active by commenting on posts of companies I'm interested in working for and creating my own posts of coding projects that I work on (In both my ITI and SEG courses). Another thing I will work on is expanding my network by connecting with people I meet at networking events, alumni's in positions that I am interested in, and my fellow classmates. During this process, I will make sure to write specific invite messages showing my interest in the person and I won't ask any favors until they know me better.
